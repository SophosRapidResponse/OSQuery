| DESCRIPTION                                                                    |
| Check for process execution, data from 'sophos_process_journal' with joins on  |
| 'user' and 'file'. Similar but simpler to 'Process.04.0'. Good for collecting  |
| small amounts of data from specific times.                                     |
|                                                                                |
| VARIABLES                                                                      |
| - start_time (TYPE: DATE) = datetime of when to start hunting                  |
| - end_time (TYPE: DATE) = when to stop hunting                                 |
|                                                                                |
| TIP                                                                            |
| If you want to collect multiple days worth of data you can either set the      |
| begin time to 00:00:00 and the end time to 23:59:59 and collect specific days  |
| or you could use the other query 'Process.04.0' which is better for mass       |
| collection across multiple days.                                               |
|                                                                                |
