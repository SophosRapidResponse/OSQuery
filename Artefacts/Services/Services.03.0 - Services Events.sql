| Look for services being installed, started/stopped, changed, or crashed via the|
| System event log and event IDs: 7034, 7035, 7036, 7040, 7045 and Security event|
| log event ID: 4697                                                             |

| Services logs should be investigated around the time of a suspected compromise |
| Services started on boot illustrate persistence. Services can crash due to     |
| attacks like process injection.                                                |
