| Pass the hash is a method of authenticating as a user without having access to the   |
| user's cleartext password. It's usually performed using tools such as Mimikatz.      |
| Adversaries uses this method to move laterally within an environment. This event will|
| be logged on the SOURCE HOST machine.                                                |
