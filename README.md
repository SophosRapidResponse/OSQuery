# OSQuery

== Intro ==

The queries provided here were created by members of the Sophos Rapid Response team or friends of ours working within other roles in Sophos. The goal of sharing these is to help the community of defenders and Incident Response teams using Sophos EDR.

Sophos EDR uses a combination of information stored in our Data Lake, as well as a custom version of OSQuery on the local machine that includes additional Sophos created tables with a wealth of forensic data in them. For a full list see here: https://docs.sophos.com/central/References/schemas/index.html?schema=ld_schema

Many of these queries benefit from the additional Sophos tables added to OSQuery, while others will work with 3rd party products using the standard OSQuery tables.

Each query includes the author details, so if you find the query useful or spot any improvements feel free to reach out.
