| Look for suspicious services being installed via the System event log and      |
| Event ID 7045. This is a good query for finding Cobalt Strike services as      |
| PsExec and other suspicious services.                                          |
|                                                                                |
| SAFE IMAGE PATH                                                                |
| Some image paths contain malicious scripts or encoded PowerShell that once     |
| exported to Excel can get detected, if you want to keep a record of            |
| potentially malicious scripts you can use the 'Safe_Image_Path' value, this    |
| is still human readable and can be decoded with CyberChef here:                |
